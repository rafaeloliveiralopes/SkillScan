About Us

We are Binho. We build the products people talk about.

We develop, sell, and support our own hardware and software products under the Binho brand as well as develop custom, bespoke solutions for our clients, often tackling projects in drone delivery, autonomous vehicles, consumer IoT, AI-enabled wearable devices, advanced robotics, non-terrestrial RF communication, industrial automation platforms, and more.

Our internally developed products are used by 175+ teams at global semiconductor companies, a reach made possible by the way we’ve engineered the playbook for making hybrid teams deliver outstanding results. That expertise has also made us recognized industry leaders in I3C protocol implementation and verification — and as MIPI Alliance contributor members, we’re helping shape the ongoing I3C specification itself.

We’re doing extraordinary work. If you’re exceptional and want to create technology that pushes boundaries and defines the future, we want you on our team.

About This Role

We're looking for a Senior Firmware Engineer to take ownership of complex embedded systems projects from concept to production. You'll lead firmware architecture, make key technical decisions, and mentor junior engineers — all while working alongside some of the best hardware engineers in the industry.

Your work will range from our own USB host adapters to custom embedded solutions for major clients. You'll solve challenging real-time system problems, design for resource-constrained environments, and integrate closely with hardware teams to create products that shape how leading companies develop hardware. In this role, you'll have the autonomy to drive architecture and implementation while setting high engineering standards for the team.

Main Responsibilities

Architect and implement advanced embedded firmware for complex microcontroller-based systems
Lead technical projects from concept through production with minimal supervision
Drive firmware architecture decisions and establish coding standards
Mentor junior and mid-level engineers through code reviews and technical guidance
Solve complex problems involving real-time systems, communication protocols, and hardware integration
Collaborate closely with hardware teams on system-level design and optimization
Optimize performance of resource-constrained embedded systems
Lead debugging efforts for the most challenging firmware and system issues
Contribute to technical planning and provide accurate project estimates
Interface with clients on technical requirements and implementation approaches
Requirements

6+ years of embedded firmware development experience
Expert-level proficiency in C/C++ for embedded systems
Deep experience with microcontroller architectures and real-time systems
Advanced ability to read, analyze, and collaborate on complex electronic schematics and hardware design
Advanced knowledge of communication protocols (USB, UART, SPI, I2C, Ethernet)
Strong understanding of hardware-software integration and embedded system design
Experience with RTOS implementation and real-time system optimization
Proficiency with debugging tools, logic analyzers, and embedded development environments
Solid background in software architecture and design patterns for embedded systems
Ability to mentor junior engineers and conduct comprehensive code reviews
Comfortable level of English (written and spoken)
Strong problem-solving skills and ability to work independently on complex projects
Preferred

Experience with USB host/device development and complex communication stacks
Knowledge of low-level driver development and hardware abstraction layers
Background in test and measurement equipment or development tools
Understanding of power management and low-power embedded design
Familiarity with automated testing and continuous integration for embedded systems
Experience with FPGA integration and hardware acceleration
Knowledge of safety-critical systems and regulatory compliance
Understanding of manufacturing processes and production firmware considerations
We Offer

Work with major technology companies and rising Silicon Valley startups
Professional development and continuous learning opportunities
Dynamic and innovative work environment with travel opportunities and positive, collaborative atmosphere
Flexible schedules and supportive work culture
Clear growth path as the company expands
