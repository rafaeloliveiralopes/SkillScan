# Product context — purpose

## Why this project exists

This project exists to help job seekers quickly understand how well they match a job description (JD) without manual, time-consuming comparison. By turning long JDs into a concise, actionable summary (matched skills, gaps, and next steps), it reduces friction and uncertainty during job applications.

The project is open source to enable transparent learning, community contribution, and reuse by students and developers who want to study or extend a practical, real-world AI tool.

## Problems it solves

- JDs are lengthy and hard to parse; candidates waste time extracting key requirements.
- Candidates struggle to objectively compare their skills against the JD.
- It’s unclear which gaps matter most and what to do next.
- Early screening often happens under time pressure; people need a fast, offline aid.

## Who it helps (personas)

1. **Junior/Intern candidate**  
   Wants a quick, objective read on a JD to know if it’s worth applying and which skills to prioritize in the short term.

2. **Career switcher**  
   Needs a clear diagnosis of gaps and a practical plan to become competitive for targeted roles.

3. **Student/OSS contributor**  
   Looks for a simple, useful, well-structured open source project to learn from and contribute to (tests, tooling, heuristics).
